# Shad0w Synd1cate Website

## Right now in the planning stages.

This project will be the main website for the Shad0w Synd1cate Cybersecurity And IT Computer group of Las Vegas Nevada.  
This site should be accessible by the members of the group who wish to contribute to the site's content, so a Content Management System such as Dango should be adequate (for now, at least).  
This site should also accommodate the various projects and presentations from the members of the group.

## I'm starting by prototyping with Python 3.6 and Django.
