## Shad0w Synd1cate Static Site  

This is a basic static website that can be deployed to an S3 bucket on AWS and used for experiments, prototyping, user feedback, and so on.

### TODO:  

Start at the bottom of the index.html files and modify the link and script tags so that all of the Django and Divio code is removed.  
I want to see if I can make a scaled-down version of the fully functional site.
